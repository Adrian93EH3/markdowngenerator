# Markdown Generator
This is my proud work showcasing a markdown generator I created. Without that starter template, this most likely would not have been done. Jeff helped out tremendously with the formatting of the inquirer prompt([]) portion as well as the spread technique we can do to call a variable, thanks Jeff! Max helped me with a silly but detrimental camelCasing issue, thanks Max!
