# Markdown Generator
This is my proud work showcasing a markdown generator I created.

# Description
Without that starter template, this most likely would not have been done. Creating this markdown generator with node.js was pretty neat. I loved the incorporation of using Bash to run everything. I never thought the command prompt would be used for anything other than: mkdir, pwd, ls, ls -a, and git commands. Back to the work. I was stumped with a global variable I had called and couldn't figure out why it was giving me a null value. After half an hour of not being able to debug it myself, I called out for help and Max was thankfully able to squeeze me in for a 5 minute call to help me get out of the rut. A dang camelCase error. I had put generateMarkdown as the global and called it as generateMarkDown. Thank you Max. After using the amazing starter template Jeff showed us in OH, it all clicked. I want to thank you all for being an amazing support system. Down below you'll find my work.
